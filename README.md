Case Study Smart Contract
This repository contains a Solidity smart contract designed to manage interactive case studies on the blockchain. The contract allows the creation of scenarios where users can make decisions and progress through a series of challenges.

Vision
Our vision is to revolutionize how educational and professional case studies are conducted by leveraging blockchain technology. This system offers transparency, fairness, and a decentralized approach to learning and assessment.
